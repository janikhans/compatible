        <p>Compatible is a searchable database built by you and all the other garage tinkerers around the world. Have you stumbled across a part that fits another project you have? Go ahead and submit it. Doing so allows the next person whoâ€™s in your same situation, to find an alternative. Using our databse we are able to further piece together a compatibility web so that new possible solutions are always right at hand.</p>
